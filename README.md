# breast-cancer-predictor

The project is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on measurements of cell nuclei. The app leverages a machine learning logistic regression model trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Features

Cell Nuclei Measurements: Users can input various cell nuclei measurements via sliders in the sidebar.
Radar Chart Visualization: Visual representation of the input data on a radar chart.
Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of the breast mass being benign or malignant using a trained logistic regression model.
Probability Output: Displays the probabilities of the mass being benign or malignant.
Data

The app uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which includes features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
